Issue of interest: 
     “Drugged Driving”
                    Drugged driving is driving a vehicle while impaired due to the intoxicating effects of recent drug use. It can make driving a car unsafe—just like driving after drinking alcohol. Drugged driving puts the driver, passengers, and others who share the road at serious risk.
Why this issue?
                      It is observed that 44 percent of drivers in fatal car crashes (with known results) tested positive for drugs. It is also found that among drug-tested fatally injured drivers in 2016, 38% tested positive for some form of marijuana, 16% tested positive for opioids, and 4% tested positive for both marijuana and opioids. The publication also highlights the frequency of poly-drug use, or the use of multiple potentially impairing substances simultaneously.
Questions I’d try to answer:
By analyzing the place of death, we will come to know whether the death has happened when they are in Home or they consumed drugs outside the home like when they were in parties and met with an accident.
By analyzing the manner of the death, we will come to know the behavior of the person after consuming drugs like if the death happened as an accident, we can come to an assumption that people like to drive or go out once they consume drugs.

Data Source location:   https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/accidental-drug-related-deaths-january-2012-sept-2015
Data is legal and there is no analysis made on it previously by anyone.
Unit of analysis:  Drug Abusers
Variables/Measures:  I would like to analyze the age group of the Drug abusers and the pattern whether the deaths in a year is increasing or decreasing and also visualize it.

I would like to use the Bar Graph to show the spike of the deaths reported in every single year and also the age group of the people abusing drugs.
